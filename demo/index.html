  <h3 class="block w30 h2">About Quadrille</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h16">
    Want to put some stuff on a square grid? Quadrille generates easy
    classes in SCSS and uses a jQuery plugin to keep everything
    snapped to the grid. <span class="h">Resize
    the window to see things snap.</span> Inspect the elements
    and you'll see them stay true.<br><br>
    This is probably only useful if you&rsquo;re working with square,
    fixed grids and need an easy coordinate system to play with. If
    that is what you&rsquo;re up to, Quadrille will make your life
    way easier.<br><br>
    If you just want grids, you probably want to play with
    a proper framework, not this. This was originally made as a
    proof-of-concept for a really odd client request: a full-screen
    image with a grid overlay, where the grid scaled and elastically
    centered content while always
    remaining snapped to the grid. This required
    basically recreating the viewport. You&rsquo;ll notice that layout
    used on this page.

  <div class="block h1">&nbsp;</div>
  <h3 class="block w20 h2">Prerequisites</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h6">
  Before you can play with Quadrille, you will need to make sure you
  have <span class="h">Sass</span>. If you don&rsquo;t have Sass installed,
  just run <br><br>
  <code>$ gem install sass</code>
  <br><br>
  and everything will be OK.
  </p>
  <div class="block h1">&nbsp;</div>
  <h3 class="block w20 h2">Easy: Autogenerate Code</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h19">
  The hardest part of Quadrille is configuration, and it&rsquo;s not
  very hard. Before you start with Quadrille, you&rsquo;ll need to know
  your <span class="h">grid size</span> and <span class="h">grid
  offsets</span>.<br><br>
  Your <span class="h">grid size</span> is how big of an x/y grid you
  need. (In the case of this page, it&rsquo;s 24x24.)<br><br>
  Your <span class="h">grid offset</span> is the offset within the
  grid background image that the intersection point is. This page&rsquo;s
  grid intersects directly in the middle, at (12,12).<br><br>
  If you know these, you&rsquo;re good to go. Run Quadrille's
  code generator:<br><br>
  <code>$ ./quadrille</code>
  <br><br>
  Follow the steps.
  If you forgot to install Sass the generator will complain.
  </p>
  <h3 class="block w20 h2">Advanced: Configure Manually</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h9">
  Quadrille extends jQuery. If you are proficient with jQuery and want
  to generate your own code, include <code>jquery.quadrille.min.js</code>
  and work from there. Your code will look like:<br><br>
  <code>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;$.quadrille({<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// your options go here<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;});
  </code>
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h6">
  The jQuery plugin has a few different options: <code>grid_size</code>,
  <code>grid_offset_x</code>, <code>grid_offset_y</code>,
  <code>animate_on_resize</code>, <code>resize_timer_resolution</code>,
  and <code>background_image_url</code>. The code autogenerator sets
  the basics <code>grid_size</code>, <code>grid_offset_x</code>,
  and <code>grid_offset_y</code> for a new user.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h2">
  <code class="h">grid_size</code> is the size of your square grid, in
  pixels.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h3">
  <code class="h">grid_offset_x</code> is the offset in the x axis to
  the centerpoint of your grid.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h3">
  <code class="h">grid_offset_y</code> is the offset in the y axis to
  the centerpoint of your grid.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h4">
  <code class="h">animate_on_resize</code> is a boolean value that
  animates the elastic grid movement upon resize so it
  &ldquo;slides&rdquo; back onto the grid. This defaults to
  <code>false</code>. It is experimental.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h5">
  <code class="h">resize_timer_resolution</code> is an integer that
  buffers the animation resize. This stops the animations from stacking
  up and getting ridiculous when the window is resized all over the
  place wildly. This is defaulted to a subjective number.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h5">
  <code class="h">background_image_url</code> is the URL to a fixed,
  full-screen background image if you need one. Quadrille creates the
  image tags necessary for this to work and handles the full-screen
  zooming for you.
  </p>
  <h3 class="block w20 h2">Designing with Quadrille</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h6">
  Quadrille is meant to be used with no understanding of anything but
  very basic
  HTML and CSS. You should not have to touch anything else. Because
  of this, Quadrille has a very verbose class syntax that allows you to
  develop on fixed grids up to 5000px by 5000px with just different
  classes.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h5">
  For example, this text uses the classes
  <code>block w30 h5</code>. That sounds nasty but it
  isn&rsquo;t when it is explained. Quadrille has
  <span class="h">blocks</span>, <span class="h">dimensions</span>, and
  <span class="h">floaters</span>. In this paragraph&rsquo;s case, its
  block is <code>block</code>, its dimensions <code>w30</code> and
  <code>h5</code>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="block w20 h2">Blocks</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h3">
  <span class="h">Blocks</span> come in four different flavors:
  <code class="h">block</code>, <code class="h">gblock</code>,
  <code class="h">relblock</code> and <code class="h">absblock</code>,
  all of which get positioned differently.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h3">
  <span class="h"><code>block</code></span> takes up an entire
  row even if your grid dimension doesn&rsquo;t go that far. It works
  like a normal block element.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h4">
  <span class="h"><code>gblock</code></span> creates a
  <span class="h">grid</span> block. These float to the left and allow
  you to put many of them side by side. They will wrap at the width
  of <code>qdr-maincontent</code> (the elastic grid container).
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h4">
  <span class="h"><code>relblock</code></span> relatively positions
  a block. These blocks are still considered in the flow, so you will
  not have two relblocks appear adjacent to one another.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h3">
  <span class="h"><code>absblock</code></span> allows you to
  arbitrarily place blocks wherever you please on the coordinate
  grid.
  </p>
  <h3 class="block w20 h2">Dimensions</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h7">
  <span class="h">Dimensions</span> give blocks graphical coordinates
  or sizes. Dimensions come in a few different types:
  <code class="h">w</code>, <code class="h">h</code>,
  <code class="h">s</code>, <code class="h">x</code>,
  <code class="h">y</code>, <code class="h">lh</code>, and
  <code class="h">fs</code>. All of these are short names, and all do
  only one thing: set a certain dimension or offset on the page to
  a multiple of your grid size. There is also a special dimension
  class called <code class="h">offset</code> but we&rsquo;ll get to that
  later.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h4">
  <code class="h">w</code> dimensions are <span class="h">width</span>
  dimensions. For example, <code>w1</code> will set your element to exactly
  one grid square wide. <code>w10</code> will set the element to exactly
  ten squares wide, and so on.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h3">
  <code class="h">h</code> dimensions are <span class="h">height</span>
  dimensions and work exactly like width blocks, only vertically.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h4">
  <code class="h">s</code> dimensions are <span class="h">space</span>
  dimensions. They are only useful really for <code>gblock</code> (grid
  blocks). They add blank space in between different grid blocks.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h5">
  <code class="h">x</code> dimensions are <span class="h">x-coordinate</span>
  dimensions, which you use with <code>absblock</code> or
  <code>relblock</code> structures. x-dimensions work the way you'd expect
  from the top of your grid to the right. For example, <code>x1</code>
  would be in the first square of your grid.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h6">
  <code class="h">y</code> dimensions are <span class="h">y-coordinate</span>
  dimensions. Unlike the way a geometric y-axis works, y increments (gets
  bigger) as you go <span class="h">down</span> the page instead of up
  like a normal coordinate grid. This is normal for the web. As an
  example, <code>y7</code> is seven grid squares down from the top of your grid.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h5">
  <code class="h">lh</code> dimensions are a convenience dimension. They set the
  font&rsquo;s line height to a multiple of the grid.
  <code class="h">fs</code> are also a font convenience dimension, setting
  the font size to a multiple of the grid.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h6">
  <code class="h">offset</code>, <code class="h">offset-x</code>, and
  <code class="h">offset-y</code> are special dimensional classes. If
  you aren&rsquo;t working inside <code>mainContent</code> and want to
  arbitrarily place blocks, these will compensate for your grid offset.
  They&rsquo;re for being powerful. <code>offset</code> offsets in both
  x and y directions, while the others only offset in one.
  </p>
  <h3 class="block w20 h2">Floaters</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h4">
  <span class="h">Floaters</span> control the floating/nesting structure
  of the grid. They are for use with <code>gblock</code> (grid blocks)
  only. They are <code class="h">clearleft</code>,
  <code class="h">clearright</code>, and <code class="h">clearboth</code>.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h4">
  <code class="h">clearleft</code> clears grid bits floating to the left.
  This is a shortcut for the CSS <code>clear: left;</code> and you should
  use this with a <code>gblock</code> if you don&rsquo;t want anything
  to the side of it.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h3">
  <code class="h">clearright</code> does the same, but to the right:
  anything floated to the right will be cleared.
  </p>
  <p class="block w30 h3">
  <code class="h">clearboth</code> is the hammer that clears everything
  in both directions, in case you need to go Conan on your grid.
  </p>
  <h3 class="block w20 h2">Compatibility</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h7">
  Quadrille should work in Internet Explorer 8 or higher. You might have luck
  with older browsers but it isn&rsquo;t tested in those. If for some
  reason your client does not have JavaScript enabled, the site will try
  to gracefully break down and not snap to the elastic grid. This is a
  rather large rarity in today&rsquo;s browsing environment.
  </p>
  <h3 class="block w20 h2">Reporting Bugs</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h4">
  If you have found a bug in Quadrille, please open an issue on GitHub.
  If you are a smart developer, you can issue your own fix as well.
  </p>
  <h3 class="block w20 h2">Licensing</h3>
  <p class="block w30 h7">
